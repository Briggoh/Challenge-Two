# Flexbox-Portfolio
For this project, I have constructed a functional website which acts as a portfolio and introduction to my work as a software engineer. 
Key features of this page include an "about me" section, a section containing my projects with my most recent work being most prominent, and a "contact me" section. 
With the base HTML file, I have attached a Javascript and CSS file to increase functionality and make the interface more user-friendly.
