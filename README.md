# Flexbox-Portfolio
For this project, I have constructed a functional website which acts as a portfolio and introduction to my work as a software engineer. 
Key features of this page include an "about me" section, a section containing my projects with my most recent work being featured most prominently, and a "contact me" section. 
With the base HTML file, I have attached a Javascript and CSS file to increase functionality and make the interface more user-friendly. I have included a screenshot of the project below.
