# Flexbox-Portfolio
For this project, I have constructed a functional website which acts as a portfolio and introduction to my work as a software engineer. 
Key features of this page include an "about me" section, a section containing my projects with my most recent work being featured most prominently, and a "contact me" section. 

Along with the base HTML file, I have attached a Javascript and CSS file to increase functionality and make the interface more user-friendly. I will be updating this website periodically and applying new skills that I have learned through my course with UC Berkeley, so check-in periodically for new features!

Attached below is a screenshot of the home-page of my portfolio. This is what greets you as you enter teh webpage!
